## Ways of Working

There are some basic ways of working with the Druapl project to ensure consistency and code quality across the team.

* We use feature branching and merge all code back into the master branch via PRs.
  Feature branches should preferably be named after the task number.

* We request peer reviews from other developers against all completed tasks.
